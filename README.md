👋 Hi, I’m @BeatriceDuncan

🧡 The thing I value most is human connection & this underlies everything else I do.

🖍️ I’m interested in drawing, sewing and eating.

🌱 I’m always learning - currently building up my front end development skills, JavaScript (vanilla JS, React & jQuery) in particular.

👀 I'm looking for full time work as a Front End Developer
